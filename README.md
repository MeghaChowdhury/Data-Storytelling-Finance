## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between **infrastructure access** â€” specifically **electricity** and **internet availability** â€” and **education outcomes** across countries of different income levels. The analysis was conducted as part of the *Data Storytelling in Finance* course, with a focus on transforming raw data into an engaging, interactive narrative.

The project was implemented as an **interactive R Shiny dashboard**, allowing users to explore patterns, correlations, and comparisons between countries and income groups.

##  Dataset
The dataset comes from the **World Bank Open Data** repository and includes:
- **Electricity access (%)**
- **Internet users (%)**
- **GDP per capita (current US$)**
- **Education outcomes** (e.g., school enrollment rates, literacy rates)
- **Country income classifications**

Data covers multiple countries and years, enabling both **cross-country** and **time-series** comparisons.  
*Note: The full dataset is not included in this repository due to file size limitations, but it can be obtained directly from the [World Bank Data Portal](https://data.worldbank.org/).*

##  Main Findings
1. **Electricity access and education outcomes** are strongly correlated in lower-income countries, but the relationship flattens for high-income nations where access is already universal.
2. **Internet penetration** is a more significant predictor of improved education outcomes in middle-income countries than in low-income countries.
3. **High GDP per capita** does not guarantee the highest education outcomes â€” some upper-middle-income countries outperform high-income ones in specific metrics.
4. The interactive visualizations reveal clear **regional clusters** where infrastructure and education progress together.
