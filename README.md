## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between **infrastructure access** â€” specifically **electricity** and **internet availability** â€” and **education outcomes** across countries of different income levels.  
The analysis was conducted as part of the *Data Storytelling in Finance* course, with a focus on transforming raw data into a compelling data-driven narrative.

##  Dataset

The dataset comes from the **World Bank Open Data** repository and includes:

- **Electricity access (% of population)**
- **Internet users (% of population)**
- **GDP per capita (current US$)**
- **Education indicators** (e.g., secondary school completion, enrollment, literacy)
- **Country income classifications** (Low, Lower-Middle, Upper-Middle, High)

The data spans multiple years and countries, allowing for both **cross-country** and **time-series** comparisons.

> *Note: The full dataset is not included in this repository due to file size constraints, but it can be accessed via the [World Bank Data Portal](https://data.worldbank.org/).*

##  Main Findings

1. **Electricity access and education outcomes** are strongly correlated in lower-income countries, but the relationship flattens for high-income nations.
2. **Internet penetration** tends to be a more significant predictor of improved education outcomes in middle-income countries.
3. **High GDP per capita** does not automatically translate into better education outcomes â€” some upper-middle-income countries outperform high-income ones on key metrics.
4. **Regional clusters** show infrastructure and education often advance hand-in-hand, but disparities persist where investment is lacking.
